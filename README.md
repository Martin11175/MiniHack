# Welcome to the MiniHacks!

This repository contains all of our minihack challenges and everyone's uploaded solutions.
Please see the individual folders for each challenge's description and goal but the language you use is down to you!
New challenges will be revealed on the day of the minihack but you're welcome to tackle any past challenges as you please to try for a better score (and be honest when posting your results!).

Generally these problems should be simple enough to solve in a single file, so if you could name the file (or folder if required) as your username under the folder for each challenge it would be greatly appreciated.

Best of luck and feel free to contact [Martin Higgs](mhiggs@factset.com) or [Kiran Patel](kpatel02@factset.com) with any questions or suggestions; we'd love to hear from you!
